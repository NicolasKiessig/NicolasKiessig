<h1 align="center">Greetings, I'm Nicolas Kiessig</h1>
<h3 align="center">Driven by understanding data and making predictions</h3>

Throughout my career, I have had the chance to study and analyze data of different sets of problems, ranging from a diner's marketing plans to analyzing gas prices in a small town in Parana to cleaning a dataset of public companies and their main credit metrics for a BI dashboard.

With my bachelor's degree in Economics and my previous experiences, I've developed a diverse set of skills that combine my knowledge of finances with my aptitude to handle, analyze, and gather insights from data.

I'm looking for an opportunity to develop myself as a Data Scientist and put in practice all that I'm learning.
